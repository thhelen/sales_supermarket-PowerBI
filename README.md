# Supermarket Sales Analysis
## Overview

This project is my exploration of supermarket sales data using Power BI, with data extraction and preprocessing done in Python. The dataset covers three months of transactions from a supermarket chain with three branches, providing insights into customer behavior, sales trends, and overall business performance. My goal is to create interactive visualizations that help uncover patterns and support data-driven decision-making.

## Data Extraction & Preprocessing
I extracted the dataset using the Kaggle API and performed preprocessing in Python before importing it into Power BI. The preprocessing steps included:

* Handling missing values
* Converting date and time formats
* Calculating additional metrics where necessary
* Filtering and cleaning the data for better visualization


## Dataset Information

The dataset includes detailed sales records with attributes such as:

* Invoice ID – Unique identifier for each transaction
* Branch & City – Location of the supermarket branch
* Customer Type – Membership status (Member/Normal)
* Gender – Customer gender information
* Product Line – Categories like electronics, fashion, and food
* Unit Price & Quantity – Price per item and number of units purchased
* Total Sales – Final purchase amount, including tax
* Payment Method – Cash, credit card, or e-wallet
* COGS & Gross Income – Cost of goods sold and profit margin
* Customer Rating – Satisfaction score (1 to 10)

## Power BI Report
I have designed several Power BI dashboards to analyze different aspects of the data:

* Sales Overview 
* Branch Performance 
* Customer Insights 
* Product Line Trends
* Time of Day Analysis

## Purpose
My aim with this project is to integrate Python and Power BI for a complete data analytics workflow. By automating data extraction, preprocessing, and visualization, I can efficiently analyze sales trends and customer preferences.
